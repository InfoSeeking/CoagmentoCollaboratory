#Coagmento Toolbar

## Considerations
- Somehow we need to store the userID and the private key locally. Perhaps we can have them enter in their login in the form. This can retrieve the userID and private key 
and store it permanently somehow.
- I need a better way to do this development instead of editing => packaging => removing => adding => restarting just to test
- Need to add timestamps to requests

## Progress/Updates
- Snippet button is working with userID and private key hard coded
- Bookmark button is working
